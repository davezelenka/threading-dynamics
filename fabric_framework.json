  "abstract": "We present a comprehensive mathematical framework proposing that spacetime, particles, and fundamental forces emerge from threading patterns in a pre-geometric substrate. Rather than treating space as fundamental, we derive spatial structure from phase coherence relations established by light threading at rate c. Particles arise as topologically stable defects (knotted vortices) in this threading field, with properties determined by a fitness landscape favoring configurations with optimal beauty, resonance, and topological stability. This document provides: (1) complete mathematical formalism, (2) explicit calculation protocols, (3) falsifiable predictions, and (4) identified research gaps. The framework is designed for independent verification and collaborative exploration across theoretical physics, numerical topology, and experimental testing.",
