# Threading Dynamics Repository

The **Threading Dynamics** repository contains research, analyses, and datasets relating to the **Fabric Paradigm**, a conceptual framework that interprets reality as a living fabric of light, memory, and agency. This framework unifies phenomena across physics, biology, cognition, and ecological systems through shared threading dynamics.

## Repository Overview

The repository includes:

- **Analysis Scripts (`analysis.py`)**  
  Scripts implementing computational analyses and data exploration across multiple ecological, physical, and conceptual studies. These scripts focus on emergent patterns, memory dynamics, and coherence evolution.

- **Datasets**  
  Original data used for analyses, including ecological datasets (forest fires, alpine grasslands, desert seed banks) and other experimental or observational studies. Data are organized per study.

- **Outputs**  
  Summary tables, CSVs, and JSON results capturing memory redistribution, disturbance response, functional recovery, and other threading-related metrics.

- **Documentation**  
  Markdown summaries and hypothesis testing overviews connecting observed patterns to the Threading Dynamics framework.

## Key Concepts

The **Fabric Paradigm** frames reality as a coherent structure of light threading, where:

- All phenomena arise from **threading dynamics** guided by choice or agency.  
- Memory and latent potential influence system behavior and recovery after disturbance.  
- Coherence, resonance, and redistribution are fundamental processes connecting micro- and macro-scale patterns.  
- Disturbances are not purely destructive but act as **reorganization events**, reshaping stored memory and system coherence.  

This framework allows interdisciplinary exploration, linking physics, ecology, cognition, and organizational systems under a shared conceptual model.

## Usage

- Clone the repository and navigate to the relevant study folder.
- Run `analysis.py` to reproduce analyses, generate summary tables, and view hypothesis support.  
- Outputs are saved as CSVs and JSON files, providing per-sample and per-group summaries.
