  "abstract": "We propose Threaded Mind (TM) theory: consciousness as recursive fabric arising through the same threading dynamics that organize matter, ecosystems, and social systems. Drawing on the Threading Ecology framework, we reconceptualize thought, emotion, memory, and pathology as patterns of active and latent memory states within a self-reflective cognitive ecology. Mental health emerges from fluid threading dynamics, while pathology reflects frozen knots (trauma), chaotic turbulence (anxiety), or rigid loops (depression). Healing occurs through disturbance-redistribution cycles that convert pathological active memory (M_active) into latent substrates (M_latent), enabling reorganization and integration. Integrating insights from Piaget, Jung, Bateson, and Varela, TM theory frames consciousness not as computational representation but as fabric reflecting on its own weaving. We outline measurable predictions linking coherence gradients (beauty, B), resonance (R), and agency (A) to neural synchrony, therapeutic recovery, and collective entrainment. This framework reframes mental health as ecosystem management and creativity as the emergence of latent memory into active form.",

Provides ontological foundation for consciousness (fabric reflecting on own weaving) that resolves hard problem. Generates testable predictions linking neural coherence to therapeutic outcomes, creative emergence, collective synchronization. Bridges mind, life, matter under unified threading dynamics."
