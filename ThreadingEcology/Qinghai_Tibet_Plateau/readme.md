## Dataset Description

This dataset originates from extensive field sampling and laboratory measurements across three alpine grassland types on the **Qinghai‚ÄìTibet Plateau**. It includes paired observations under plateau pika (*Ochotona curzoniae*) disturbance and undisturbed conditions, enabling robust assessments of **biodiversity and ecosystem multifunctionality**.

Each plot includes the following:

* **Biodiversity indicators:**
  Plant diversity, soil nematode diversity, and soil microbial (bacteria and fungi) diversity based on standardized quadrat sampling.
* **Ecosystem function indicators:**
  Aboveground biomass (AGB), soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (N), total phosphorus (P), available nitrogen (NH‚ÇÑ‚Å∫, NO‚ÇÉ‚Åª), available phosphorus (AP), and soil moisture (SM).

Sampling was conducted on **90 paired plots (180 total)** across three alpine grassland types, using a **stratified paired design** to capture disturbance effects.

The dataset supports research on how small burrowing herbivores influence **biodiversity‚Äìmultifunctionality relationships** and **ecosystem memory dynamics**.

**Original data file:** `data.csv`
Columns:
`plot_id, Grassland_type, Pika_type, Plant, Nematode, Bacteria, Fungi, SOC, N, P, NH4, NO3, AP, SM, AGB, Biodiversity, Mean_EMF, Effective_EMF, ...`

**Biodiversity‚ÄìMultifunctionality coupling:**

* Spearman‚Äôs œÅ = **0.71**, *p* < 1√ó10‚Åª¬π‚Å¥, *n* = 90
  ‚Üí Functional resilience is strongly tied to biodiversity retention.

## Interpretation (Threading Ecology Context)

* **H1 ‚Äì Threading‚ÄìDisturbance Cycles:**
  Pika disturbance redistributes biomass and nutrients, initiating new threading and recovery cycles.

* **H2 ‚Äì Memory Gradient Triggers:**
  Steep SOC gradients predict disturbance magnitude‚Äîsupporting memory-buffered stability.

* **H4 ‚Äì Post-Disturbance Coherence Enhancement:**
  Increased AP despite losses elsewhere signals reorganization toward new coherence configurations.

* **H5 ‚Äì Threading Density Recovery Before Composition:**
  Multifunctionality stabilizes faster than biodiversity‚Äîthreading pathways re-form before full community recovery.

* **H6 ‚Äì Multi-Phase Memory Recovery:**
  SOC‚ÄìN‚ÄìAP trajectories show alternating phases of activation, redistribution, and latent memory storage.
