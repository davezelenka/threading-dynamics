Methods
We estimated pre-fire and post-fire stem density and forest composition by measuring pre-fire (burned) trees and newly established seedlings. We counted all standing or fallen pre-fire trees and measured diameter at breast height (dbh) on all individuals taller than 1.4 m or basal diameter on all trees less than 1.4 m in height that were originally rooted in two parallel 2 m x 30 m belt-transects. Similarly, we estimated post-fire density by counting post-fire seedlings within ten randomly positioned 1 m x 1 m quadrats along the same two transects and measuring the basal diameter of at least one representative species per quadrat. We counted all post-fire stems of spruce, aspen, and birch that were rooted in quadrats, regardless of size. Given the range of time after fire that we sampled (4-13 years) we were unable to differentiate seedlings from vegetative regeneration. We calculated total density (stems ha-1) of each tree species prior to the fire. We used published allometric equations to calculate pre-fire (Alexander and Mack 2016) and post-fire (Johnstone et al. 2020) species-specific aboveground tree biomass (g m-2). We then calculated the proportion of deciduous stems relative to total stems in both the pre-fire and post-fire stand (relative deciduous density) and the proportion of deciduous biomass relative to total biomass in both the pre-fire and post-fire stand (relative deciduous biomass). We classified sites into pre-fire and post-fire tree species dominance classes based on a deciduous fraction index (DI) calculated from the survey data (DI=relative density plus relative biomass of deciduous tree seedlings divided by two and multiplied by 100). When DI was ?33.33%, sites were classified as black spruce (hereafter Spruce). Sites were classified as mixed black spruce-deciduous (hereafter Mixed) if DI was >33.33% and <66.66%, and as deciduous if DI was ?66.66%. We used biomass rather than the more typical basal area because biomass accounts for the different allometric scaling relationships between black spruce and deciduous tree species. Based on pre- and post-fire DI and spruce density, we categorized sites in seven classes representing observed transitions in stand dominance after fire: 1) Spruce to Deciduous, 2) Spruce to Mixed, 3) Spruce to Spruce, 4) Spruce thinning (where post-fire spruce density was less than pre-fire spruce density), 5) Mixed to Mixed, 6) Mixed to Deciduous, and 7) Deciduous to Deciduous.
