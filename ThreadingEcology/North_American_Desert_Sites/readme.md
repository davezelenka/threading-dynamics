## Study Description & Methods (from Hosna & Faist)

* They used a **time-since-fire (TSF)** approach, sampling ~15 and ~30 years post-fire, across four desert ecoregions: two **cold deserts** (Colorado Plateau, Great Basin) and two **warm deserts** (Chihuahuan, Sonoran). ([ResearchGate][3])
* At each desert site, there are paired **burned and unburned** control plots. ([ResearchGate][3])
* In each plot, they sampled **microsites** under shrubs and interspaces (i.e. near shrub vs open ground) using **soil seed bank emergence trials** (greenhouse germination) to quantify viable seed composition. ([ResearchGate][3])
* They compared seed bank species composition, richness, functional group proportions (annuals, perennials, non-natives), and divergence across fire histories and desert types. ([ResearchGate][3])
* Key contrasts:
   • In **cold deserts**, fire had significant long-lasting effects on seed bank composition (even 30 years post-fire). ([ResearchGate][3])
   • In **warm deserts**, seed banks are more dominated by annual species, regardless of fire history. ([ResearchGate][3])
   • Microsite (shrub vs interspace) did **not** systematically influence species composition in cold deserts; but in warm deserts, species richness was higher under shrubs. ([ResearchGate][3])
* They also documented **non-native species** present in all desert seed banks, and often more abundant in burned areas, implying fire may exacerbate non-native feedbacks. ([ResearchGate][3])

## Mapping to Threading Ecology Hypotheses & Interpretation

Below is how the reported results support or map to your Threading Ecology predictions (with transparency about which parts are from the authors’ results rather than a fresh reanalysis).

| Threading Hypothesis                                   | Mapped Evidence / Inference from Hosna & Faist                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Notes & Interpretive Framing                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **H1 – Threading–Disturbance Cycles**                  | The fact that fire history continues to influence seed bank composition decades later implies a memory–disturbance cycle: past disturbance reorganizes memory stores, then the system evolves from that new state.                                                   | While they did not explicitly model cyclic memory accumulation and release, their long-term legacy results align with the notion of disturbance driving memory reorganization. |
| **H2 – Memory Gradient Triggers**                      | Differences in seed bank composition across burned and unburned plots suggest underlying memory gradients (pre-existing contrasts) that influence how strongly fire impacts seed bank dynamics.                                                                      | The authors did not compute gradient steepness metrics (like $\nabla^2 M$). Your framework interprets compositional divergence as a proxy for memory gradient steepness.       |
| **H4 – Post-Disturbance Coherence Enhancement**        | Despite disturbance, native seed bank presence persisted, and non-dominant (latent) species remained. This suggests the seed bank retains latent potential facilitating coherence restoration.                                                                       | Their data show persistence, not necessarily *greater* post-fire coherence, but your inference is that latent memory buffers the system from total collapse.                   |
| **H5 – Threading Density Recovery Before Composition** | They did not (in the published version) separately measure “threading pathways” density vs full composition recovery. However, the persistence of seed banks (latent memory) implies that structural potential remains even when aboveground composition is altered. | This is an inferred mapping, not a direct test. You might flag this as a hypothesis not fully tested by their work.                                                            |
| **H6 – Multi-Phase Memory Recovery**                   | Their observation that effects persist decades later suggests that reactivation cycles (latent → active) may occur over long time scales, fitting the “multi-phase” picture.                                                                                         | The authors discuss reorganization over time but do not explicitly delineate phases of redistribution, latency, and reactivation in the way your model does.                   |

**Summary Interpretation:**
Hosna & Faist’s long-term seed bank dataset provides empirical grounding for the idea that **disturbances reorganize ecological memory**, and that such reorganizations have enduring legacies. While not every threading hypothesis is directly tested in their work, their results affirm key premises: memory persistence, differential responses across ecosystem types (warm vs cold deserts), and the importance of latent memory reservoirs in enabling recovery.
