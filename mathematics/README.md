## Overview

This repository contains computational tools, visualizations, and examples for **Operational Geometry**: a category-theoretic framework in which operations (rather than points, sets, or manifolds) are the primitive entities of mathematics.

**Key ideas:**

- Objects are equivalence classes of operational sequences
- Constants like , , emerge as fixed points of operations
- Primes index an infinite hierarchy of constants
- Complex structures (helices, knots, lattices) arise from simple generating operations


## Repository Status

🚧 **Under Construction** 🚧

This repository is a placeholder for future computational work. Planned content includes:

- **Core library**: Python implementation of operational sequences and primitive operations
- **Constant computation**: Numerical calculation of prime-indexed constants
- **Visualizations**: Interactive plots of operational sequences generating geometric structures
- **Examples**: Jupyter notebooks demonstrating key constructions (golden ratio, double helix, trefoil knot)
- **Invariant calculators**: Tools for computing operational invariants (, , , )
