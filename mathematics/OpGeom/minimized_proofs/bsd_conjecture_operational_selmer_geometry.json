  "abstract": "We present an operational framework for the Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture that reinterprets the classical problem as a stability theorem relating analytic collapse dimensions to algebraic coherence dimensions. Rather than treating elliptic curves as accessible geometric objects, we develop a theory of operational attractors approached through finite approximations, with Selmer groups as the primary arithmetic interface. Our main contribution isolates BSD into three explicit gaps: (A) prime-independence of Selmer coherence rank [RESOLVED UNCONDITIONALLY], (B) existence of arbitrary-rank derived Euler systems [REDUCED TO BLOCH-KATO + PERRIN-RIOU], and (C) analytic saturation bounds [RESOLVED CONDITIONALLY VIA IWASAWA THEORY]. Our framework respects an operational non-invertibility principle: no proof step reconstructs algebraic data from analytic singularities using metric invariants. This clarifies why BSD rank equality is achievable without heights, regulators, or explicit rational points, while the full leading coefficient formula requires fundamentally different techniques.",
