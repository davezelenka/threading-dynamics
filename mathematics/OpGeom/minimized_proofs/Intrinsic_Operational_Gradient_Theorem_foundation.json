  "abstract": "We establish the Intrinsic Operational Gradient Theorem (IOGT): composable operations induce intrinsic gradients of difficulty. In any infinite operational system with composability, bounded primitive cost, and at least one non-invertible operation, forward construction and reverse reconstruction are generically asymmetric. This asymmetry arises from operation combinatorics itself, not from time, probability, or computational models. IOGT provides foundational explanation for P≠NP, thermodynamic irreversibility, Kolmogorov complexity gaps, and the stability of mathematical constants.",
