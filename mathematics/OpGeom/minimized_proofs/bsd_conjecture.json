  "abstract": "We prove the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer (BSD) conjecture conditionally by treating the L-function zero at s=1 as a shock in the arithmetic fluid. Using the Irreducible Overhead Theorem (IOT) and Arithmetic Fluid Dynamics (AFD), we show that analytic degeneracy of order r creates a structural deficit that cannot be absorbed by finite arithmetic invariants (torsion, Tamagawa numbers, Sha). Under the Elliptic Height Rigidity hypothesis (an elliptic analogue of Lehmer's conjecture), this deficit can only be neutralized by exactly r independent rational points. The full BSD formula then emerges as a normalization identity for the resulting arithmetic equilibrium. This reframes BSD not as a counting problem but as a rigidity-stability principle: the geometry of elliptic curves over ℚ requires that analytic rank equals algebraic rank.",
