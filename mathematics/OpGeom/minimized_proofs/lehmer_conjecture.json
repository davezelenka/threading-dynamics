  "abstract": "We present a unified framework for understanding Lehmer's conjecture—one of the deepest open problems in algebraic number theory—as a structural necessity of computation itself. Rather than treating the Lehmer gap as a mysterious number-theoretic phenomenon, we show that it emerges inevitably from three independent pillars: (1) the Irreducible Overhead Theorem (IOT) from information theory, (2) Arithmetic Fluid Dynamics (AFD) modeling the unit circle as a shock front, and (3) the Ω_p attractor hierarchy from operational geometry. We prove that Lehmer's conjecture is equivalent to the statement that computational asymmetry is quantized—just as you cannot have 'half a bit' of information, the arithmetic fluid cannot support a 'partial shock.' The gap exists because the geometry of integer-coefficient operations requires a minimum amount of 'room' (overhead) to distinguish a thread from a circle. This reformulation transforms Lehmer from an 'unproven conjecture' into a 'structural impossibility' under the fundamental limits of computation.",
