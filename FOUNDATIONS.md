## Quick Start: Core Framework

For those interested in the broader theoretical foundation of this repository, the following symbolic equations outline the threading dynamics approach:

FABRIC FOUNDATION:  
Reality is light threading itself into coherent geometry.  
All phenomena are expressions of the same threading dynamics.  

CORE EQUATIONS:  
c = ΔΦ/Δτ  (local light = fabric threading rate)  
c_path = ΔΦ/Δτ * f(∇M)  (light stretched by fabric threading; redshift ≠ recession velocity)  
E = Mc²  (energy = memory density)  
I = ∫dΦ ; S = logΩ(Φ)  (info = geometry; entropy = spread)  
P = |ψ|² / Σ|ψ|²  (quantum decision)  
t = τ  (universe experiences all time; photons Δτ ≈ 0)  
R = ΣcosΔφ  (resonance = stability)  
B = ∇C ; B=0 stable  (beauty = coherence gradient)  
g = k∇M  (gravity = flow toward memory density)  
M = M_active + M_latent  (active = expressed constraints; latent = stored, dormant)  
∂C/∂τ = f(B, R, M_active, M_latent)  (coherence evolves; latent memory can be re-threaded)  
Ψ = R(Ψ)  (consciousness = recursive threading)  

**Variables:** Φ=config, τ=depth, ΔΦ=change, Δτ=step, c=coherence rate, M=memory/mass,  
M_active/latent=constraint states, E=energy, I=info, S=entropy, Ω=state count, ψ=amp,  
P=prob, R=resonance, Δφ=phase diff, B=beauty, C=coherence, g=gravity, k=const, Ψ=consciousness order parameter.
