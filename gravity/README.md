# Fabric Framework: Toroidal Black Hole Simulations

This repository contains Python simulations exploring the **Fabric Framework** - a theoretical model that unifies physics with Biblical theology through the concept of memory density as a fundamental property of reality. The simulations focus on toroidal black hole structures where memory density creates gravitational effects.

## Theoretical Background

The Fabric Framework proposes that:

- **Memory density (M)** is a fundamental field that creates gravitational effects
- **Agency** is fundamental rather than emergent, driving systems toward harmonic beauty
- **Time** represents threading depth rather than duration
- **Physical constants** emerge from natural resonance points where agency seeks harmony

These simulations explore how memory density in toroidal configurations might behave under Born-Infeld field theory constraints, potentially offering insights into black hole physics and gravitational lensing.

## File Overview

### 1. speculative_gravity_figures.py

**Purpose:** Static analysis of toroidal memory density distributions

**Features:**

- Computes gradient fields and identifies photon ring locations
- Calculates Born-Infeld energy density with saturation effects
- Produces visualization plots for memory density, gradient magnitude, and energy density

**Key Physics:** Explores how memory density gradients create "photon rings" - regions of maximum gravitational gradient that could trap light in circular orbits.

### 2. black_hole_evolution.py

**Purpose:** Time-dependent evolution of toroidal memory density with gravitational lensing

**Features:**
- Implements time evolution of M(ρ,z,t) using Born-Infeld flux limiting
- Includes source terms for memory density accretion
- Projects 3D toroidal structure to 2D surface density
- Performs thin-lens gravitational lensing calculations
- Generates synthetic lensed images showing gravitational effects

**Key Physics:** Demonstrates how memory density flows are regulated by Born-Infeld theory, preventing infinite gradients while allowing realistic gravitational lensing effects.

### 3. black_hole_images.py

**Purpose:** Parameter study of toroidal thickness effects on black hole properties

**Features:**
- Systematic variation of torus thickness parameter (σ)
- Analysis of photon ring radius dependence on geometry
- Calculation of total Born-Infeld energy as function of thickness
- Comparative visualization across parameter space

**Key Physics:** Investigates how the geometric structure of memory density affects observable properties like photon ring size and total gravitational energy.

### 4. 3d-toroidal-black_hole.py

**Purpose:** 3D visualization of toroidal black hole structure

**Features:**
- Creates 3D surface plots of memory density M(ρ,z)
- Visualizes gradient vector fields in 3D space
- Highlights predicted photon ring locations
- Provides intuitive 3D perspective on toroidal geometry

**Key Physics:** Offers spatial understanding of how memory density and its gradients create the characteristic toroidal structure proposed in the Fabric Framework.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy

## Installation

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
```

## Usage

Each script can be run independently:

```bash
python speculative_gravity_figures.py
python black_hole_evolution.py
python black_hole_images.py
python 3d-toroidal-black_hole.py
```

The scripts will generate various PNG output files and display interactive plots.

## Key Concepts

### Memory Density Field

The fundamental field M(ρ,z) represents the density of "memory" or information storage in spacetime. Higher memory density creates stronger gravitational effects.

### Born-Infeld Regulation

To prevent infinite gradients, the simulations use Born-Infeld field theory, which naturally limits field strengths and provides realistic energy densities.

### Photon Rings

Regions where the memory density gradient is maximum, potentially creating circular photon orbits similar to those observed around black holes.

### Toroidal Geometry

The characteristic donut-shaped distribution of memory density, which may represent a more fundamental structure than spherically symmetric black holes.

## Theoretical Implications

These simulations explore whether:

- Memory density could provide an alternative foundation for gravity
- Toroidal structures might be more fundamental than spherical ones
- Born-Infeld theory could naturally regulate gravitational singularities
- Observable phenomena (like photon rings) could test the Fabric Framework

## Future Directions

- Integration with observational data from Event Horizon Telescope
- Extension to rotating (Kerr-like) toroidal geometries
- Quantum corrections to the memory density field
- Connection to cosmological models and dark matter

## Note

This work represents speculative theoretical physics exploring the intersection of gravitational theory and information-theoretic approaches to spacetime. The Fabric Framework is a developing theoretical model that attempts to bridge scientific understanding with broader philosophical and theological perspectives.
