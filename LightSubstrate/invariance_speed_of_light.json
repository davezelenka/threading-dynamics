  "abstract": "The invariance of the speed of light across all reference frames has been a foundational postulate of modern physics since Einstein's special relativity. While experimentally verified, the ontological basis for this constancy remains unexplained. This paper presents Fabric Theory's resolution: the speed of light c is invariant because light itself constitutes the generative substrate—the Light Substrate (LS)—from which space, geometry, and temporal progression emerge. In a light-substrate ontology, reference frames are not independent containers that measure light, but rather coherence patterns that emerge from the LS itself. We demonstrate that c is invariant not as a speed limit imposed on spacetime, but as the foundational coherence rate at which reality is threaded. Furthermore, we clarify that time in Fabric is not a dimension but rather 'threading depth'—the cumulative action of light propagating through active memory density M_active(x,t). This reconceptualization dissolves the mystery of c's constancy and provides a naturalistic, operationally complete phenomenology for relativistic phenomena. The framework is falsifiable through predictions about substrate coherence fluctuations and threading-rate variations in extreme environments.",
